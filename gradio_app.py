### ðŸ“Š About Customer Segmentation
This dashboard uses **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** to segment customers into different behavioral groups using clustering (KMeans).

**ðŸŸ¢ Recency**: Days since last purchase  
**ðŸ”µ Frequency**: Number of purchases  
**ðŸŸ¡ Monetary**: Total spending value  

### ðŸ’¡ Segment Definitions
- **0 - Loyal Customers**: Frequent, recent, and high-spending customers.
- **1 - At-Risk**: Havenâ€™t purchased recently, medium frequency and spend.
- **2 - Potential Loyalists**: Becoming regulars, decent frequency and spend.
- **3 - Recent Big Spenders**: High spenders who just started engaging.
- **4 - Lost Customers**: Inactive, low purchase behavior.

ðŸ“¥ Try entering sample RFM values to see the predicted segment!
